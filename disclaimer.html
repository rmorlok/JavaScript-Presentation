  <a href="html5.html">This presentation</a> was created by <strong>Marcin Wichary</strong> and modified by <strong>Ernest Delgado</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The purpose of the presentation is to show the coming bleeding edge features for modern desktop and mobile browsers.
</p>
<p>
  The presentation was originally meant to run in <strong>Google Chrome</strong>. Some experimental features <strong>might or might not</strong> be coded to run in other browsers for now. (Although you will cry out of happiness when you see so much running in IE with the Chrome Frame plug-in)
</p>
<p>
  If you want to run 100% of the demos contained in the presentation you might need to run Chrome with the webgl flag enabled.
  <code>/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome -enable-webgl</code>
